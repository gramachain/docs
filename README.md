The foundation is happy to present GRAMA, a state of the art distributed blockchain-powered asset management system with exceptional speed all while being easy to use and understand.  The platform employs a hybrid delegated proof of stake and proof of ownership consensus protocol backed by industry-proven advanced cryptography.

The goal of GRAMA is to provide an open platform for the tracking and tracing of assets safely and securely with inspiration from GS1, ISO, and many other international and national standards.  

Using a distributed peer to peer network and decentralized block-web storage GRAMA is efficient and performant on lower-end computers and servers without requiring a lot of storage space either.  The unique block-web structure allows for only a minimal amount of information to be stored to validate GRAMA transactions.  

The GRAMA platform is an opt-in modular system that will is easily updatable in the future to allow for a plethora of functionality to be added quickly and safely.  Careful planning and selection using modern technologies allow for faster response times in case of an emergency.
