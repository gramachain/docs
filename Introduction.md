# Introduction

Imagine being able to scan a code on a recent purchase and know where the plant grew, in what conditions, and who handled it until you bought it.  This kind of open information is the future of supply chains and its already here today.  There are already current blockchain offerings but none that specifically target botanicals that can be used by farmers, vertical or otherwise, merchants, distributors, testing facilities, and so much more.

We present to you the worldâ€™s fastest blockchain-powered botanical track and trace platform with a full suite of free software that ensures better consumer safety and regulation adherence.  We have used the latest technology, best practices, cryptography, and a whole of experience to provide a unique modular platform.

Our goal is to present to you a no-nonsense alternative to the typical state-mandated archaic software platform.  We aim to provide an open platform where information is freely available with privacy where expected.  Regulation is easy and open for government entities and the general public.

Continue reading to gain an understanding of what we intend to provide and how it is superior to the current offerings both distributed and centralized.

Integration with current regulation systems like Metrc is provided. GRAMA will become a certified enterprise partner in order to automate integration with provided software solutions with an eventual goal of obtaining future state contracts becoming an industry leader.  

The home base for the founding team is currently the USA but the platform is intended for an international audience.
