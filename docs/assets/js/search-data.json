Instead of using the more common consensus algorithms or a single one, GRAMA uses a hybrid approach that increases initialization time, lowers hardware requirements, and saves on the required space needed to run a node. Even full archiving nodes such as delegates still only require minimal time to download. . Proof of work requires miners to calculate hashes in order to obtain a hash that meets a threshold to be considered valid. This threshold is changed in order to control the output of blocks and thus coins into the supply. The ecosystem of GRAMA does not require a controlled emission as all tokens are generated initially allowing for speed to become the primary focus next to security. Blocks can be generated as fast as they can be validated without the worry about inflating the price. There is no need for special expensive hardware as validation is doubled by ownership verification and bonds staked by elected delegates. Obvious inspiration comes from Bitcoin. . Proof of stake, most commonly, requires wallets or nodes to be connected to the network at all times increasing the demand for electricity lowering ROI. Many staking protocols are prone to manipulation by taking advantage of time and holdings. GRAMA only requires that delegates be online and active freeing users from running servers or worrying about losing their internet connection. Manipulation is avoided by the use of bonds that delegates post for each block they create that becomes forfeit if the block is voted invalid by other delegates, this removes the need for complex calculations and relying upon the accuracy of previously validated data. Calculations in GRAMA are simple and very specific to avoid tolerance levels being used to gain an advantage. Inspiration was mainly taken from Peercoin, PIVX, and more recently Tezos. . GRAMA does have an investment layer similar to masternodes in many aspects except unlike masternodes, delegates actually serve a real purpose beyond being money grabs or a form of ICO. Delegates must be vetted by the GRAMA Foundation and meet performance requirements in order to keep their active status and be elected to win rewards. Delegate performance is constantly monitored by the foundation to ensure proper operation of the network. . Instead of a specific governance protocol, a democratic approach is preferred where accounts vote for a delegate that will have a positive impact on the platform. Delegate elections are based on the popular vote of accounts at a specific time in each term. Voting can be done at any time allowing for the quick movement away from unfavorable or underperforming delegates. Experience has shown that current proposal based systems lack participation and the risk required to entice good behavior. . Most blockchain systems like Monero and Bitcoin aim at trying to keep some form of or absolute anonymity for its users while GRAMA takes a hybrid approach of public exposure and privacy. Corporations or types of partners to the platform must have their information public, just like any other store or service provider, while regular users can enjoy the privacy of staying anonymous without losing the ability to receive safety-related notifications about their purchased products. This does not prevent partners of the platform from utilizing a private chain and keeping their data completely anonymous. . Most common blockchain structures resemble that of a linked list or other linearly structured data systems. GRAMA uses a block lattice-type structure that allows for accounts to be their own sidechains that are secured with proof of ownership. As mentioned, this limits the potential impact of a compromised account to only that account but also optimizes storage space to maintain, at minimum, the head of the account or last transaction; taking space from possible terabytes of data to megabytes. If one is familiar with the technology, it is possible to run GRAMA v2 on an ESP32 microcontroller. The lattice-type structure is compromised of send transactions initiated from an account with those sends being validated by delegates in blocks. Inspiration was taken from Nano in regards to the block-lattice structure and focus on speed. . For clarification, there are two concepts of a “blockchain” in GRAMA, the central validation blockchain using a delegated proof of stake and the individual account sidechains that are backed by proof of ownership. Delegates provide another layer of validation by verifying the accuracy of transactions created by accounts and voting upon the grouping by other delegates. Accounts prove ownership of the chain and the new data associated with it using cryptographic signatures. Slight inspiration from Hyperledger and other permission-ed blockchains. . The decision to avoid the UTXO model in favor of sequencing was chosen for GRAMA in order to keep the node requirements lean while still providing the ability to perform batch transactions. Only the account can increase its sequence on its sidechain. This design decision was inspired by Stellar. .",

Go was the selected programming language of choice for the rewrite from scratch because of its support, simplicity, very easy cross-compilation, and built-in concurrency capabilities. Go was created by some of the same individuals that brought us C, UTF8, and Unix, basically very smart people. Go is not as low level as C or C++, the most commonly found languages in the space, so there are less inherent risks of exploitation. . Badger is a key-value file storage system that provides high-end performance on more common SSD drives. It is written in Go and does not require any external dependencies or interfacing. There are forks of go-eth (Ethereum) that use badger due to its performance. LevelDB implementations, at the time of writing, require interfacing overhead between Go and its native language. . Noise protocol is written in Go by Perlin Network and provides end to end encryption and Kademlia hash table routing. The interface is simple and allows for granular control of message formats while simplifying NAT traversal out of the box. LibP2P by IPFS is another popular choice for distributed networks written in Go but suffers from a specific use case not closely aligned with GRAMA’s. . ED25519 is an elliptic curve public-key signature algorithm used for accounts due in fact that it provides fast key generation, signing, and signature verification. It provides strength similar to a 3000 bit RSA and has a 2^128 target while avoiding side-channel leakage attacks. Public keys are small containing only 32 bytes without compression. This allows GRAMA to maintain its lightweight data requirements. . Delegated proof of stake adds a second layer of validation and investment that is self-regulated where all elected delegates in a term must validate every block. Delegates must also come to a majority agreement of 75% on every block in order for the block to be considered valid. . Before a delegate’s turn in block creation, it must submit a bond transaction to the network that will be held until it expires or used in a valid forfeiture. The bond transaction will be included by the next delegate if forfeit or removed from the pool. Delegates that do not produce a block within 5 seconds or it is not voted valid loses its turn and bond. . Delegated proof of stake allows for offline staking and reward potential for its constituents with kickbacks and network improvements. Accounts can elect a delegate that provides rewards creating the potential for staking pools. . Account sidechain proof of ownership empowers the modular design of GRAMA while allowing for easy additions of functionality based on an account. Ownership is proven by the account signing transactions that can be validated with the signature, sequence, and its publicly known public key. . Resource usage is light and relies heavily on the underlying cryptography which means if an account is compromised, which will happen as someone always get social engineered, the damage is limited to only that account, the perpetrator cannot prove ownership of any other account. . Required operation size for a connected node grows linearly with the number of active accounts. Account lookup, along with all sections of GRAMA’s code is asymptotically optimized for performance. . The popular vote was selected as an easy no-nonsense way of calculating totals at any given time on the blockchain. Delegates are easily selected from most votes to least with only the top 21 being selected for the next term. Delegates must provide KYC information before being accepted and the cost of maintaining minimum balances alleviates any form of Sybil attack against the voting process. . Total supply exists at the very beginning and is held in genesis accounts that are hardcoded into the consensus protocol and controlled by the foundation. Fraud is easily shown by the internal reporting requirements of the foundation that will make all transactions public knowledge. .",

Manual entry systems provide the opportunity for malicious intent making sound cybersecurity best practices even harder. Current systems are not optimal providers of accountability within the system and provide analytics for business optimization being nothing more than modern data entry terminals that mimic those of the 80s and 90s. . Health hazards or product contaminations in current tracking systems are without real-time cost-effective notification systems. Product recalls currently can cost upward of tens of millions of dollars not including the loss in sales and damaged reputation. . The current systems typically use RFID technologies that require users to purchase tags from them and do not take advantage of readily available mobile devices that can scan QR and other barcodes without the costs of unique equipment. . Centralized systems are a single point of failure, require maintenance, come with a cost, and do not offer the redundancy of a decentralized network. Servers must be maintained by a professional and often rely on 3rd party sources for hosting and connectivity while exponentially increasing the risk. . While providing no incentives to its users, the economic and environmental impacts of these legacy systems and methodologies are not forward-thinking but are in a constant state of depreciation.

    "content": "The Past Considered . Inspiration comes from current international standards like GS1 and ISO standards. They have served us well and will continue to do so in the future as they paved a way to provide regulation and standardization of processes that make supply chains and asset management better. Although these organizations and systems have made things better they also limit the availability of information to the general public and have a fiscally high point of entry. In order for a system to be widely adopted, it must accessible for everyone and easily understandable going forward. . The current most widely used blockchains today use proof of work or proof of stake, while serving its purpose, have a large negative impact on the environment and also a high point entry to use. Proof of work algorithms requires expensive hardware and high energy costs in order to be competitive while proof of stake algorithms requires large investments still being prone to manipulation due to flaws in the most commonly used staking protocols. They have been 51% attacks, stake grinding, resource exhaustion, and many other inconsistencies in current implementations over the years. . Things have been changing for the better but the need for full archiving of ledger data seems to be consistent with security and is still a misconception while common practice. There is no need to fully track everything but only what is required to ensure security is met, this is visible in the movement to using snapshots in place of full chain data for several blockchains. . In the past selecting a software solution and its hardware was an all-in commitment that has been outgrown by the incoming gig economy and subscription models. Today entities, users or corporations, should be able to easily integrate solutions that they need without committing to the costly full suite of systems of the past. . Current blockchain systems mostly provide full disclosure of all data and have resulted in the rise of private blockchains for corporations or what have you. There needs to be the possibility for public and private data going forward for a broader acceptance of the technology. . Several of the most popular blockchain systems deployed today have a long initialization period that can take weeks to become an active participant on the network, in order to cut down on these times users must have an intermediate understanding of a broad range of technologies in order to actively decrease this period without the loss of security. This is not a common acceptable metric of usability and prevents further adoption by the general public. Initialization and setup should take only minutes in order to keep with current usability trends and prevent negative psychological framing. Previously this aided in the security of the system but is no longer a requirement. .",
