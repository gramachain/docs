# Identified Problems

Manual data entry is prone to human error and can cause time delays if the information is not immediately entered in current regulatory enforced systems.  Manual entry systems provide the opportunity for malicious intent making sound cybersecurity best practices even harder.  Current systems are not optimal providers of accountability within the system and provide analytics for business optimization being nothing more than modern data entry terminals that mimic those of the 80s and 90s. 

Health hazards or product contaminations in current tracking systems are without real-time cost-effective notification systems.  Product recalls currently can cost upward of tens of millions of dollars not including the loss in sales and damaged reputation.  

The current systems typically use RFID technologies that require users to purchase tags from them and do not take advantage of readily available mobile devices that can scan QR and other barcodes without the costs of unique equipment.  

Centralized systems are a single point of failure, require maintenance, come with a cost, and do not offer the redundancy of a decentralized network.  Servers must be maintained by a professional and often rely on 3rd party sources for hosting and connectivity while exponentially increasing the risk.  

While providing no incentives to its users, the economic and environmental impacts of these legacy systems and methodologies are not forward-thinking but are in a constant state of depreciation.   Costs are passed to its users who have no choice but to go with the less than ideal circumstance or face prosecution.  

Straight to the point, current systems do not make life easier for users and there is no legitimate reasoning behind sticking with legacy monolithic systems that continue to fail over and over again.
