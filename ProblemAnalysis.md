# Problem Analysis

GRAMA focuses on the users of the system by providing a professional, researched, and tested user experience that decreases the occurrence of errors by limiting manual entry to only what is required beyond what can be realistically automated.  

The decentralized ledger that is commonly referred to as the blockchain provides optimal accountability with an open format making analytics extremely easy.  At any time from anywhere in the world, the life cycle of the product can be tracked and researched for accuracy.  Regulatory bodies don’t have to enforce reporting as it comes readily available for viewing and is encouraged by GRAMA.

The connected nature of GRAMA allows for the best safety reporting in the entire world.  Customers can be notified in real-time decreasing the potential harm and possibly save lives.  GRAMA offers targeted notifications to only affected entities in the supply chain as well as public safety notices.     

Save money by using the equipment already available without the recurring costs of RFID tags.  GRAMA can integrate several different identification systems even supplementing currently used systems.  Due to the open standard and open-source nature of the project, integrations are amongst the easiest possible.  GRAMA leverages, but not limited to, mobile technology to lower costs of operation for its users and decreases onboarding times to get up and running.    

GRAMA does not require a hosted or maintained server architecture in addition to the individual users’ hardware configurations.  There are no recurring costs for maintenance and thus no requirement to charge users to use a mandated system.  The hardware requirements for GRAMA are minimal, a Raspberry Pi is more than enough to operate the platform, most organizations already own more than enough to start using it.  Safety is not the hardware or software running the API but provided by industry-proven cryptography that is backed by vetted mathematics.  There is the potential for side-channel attacks as with any system but GRAMA protects against them as much as feasibly possible.

GRAMA has a positive environmental impact as it requires less electricity, less hardware, and minimal staff in order to operate.  Operation costs for GRAMA are pinned to transaction fees saving hundreds or even thousands a month for an average small to medium business.

GRAMA makes its users’ lives better by increasing time and money that provides the freedom to focus on other aspects of life or business.
