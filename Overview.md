# Overview

After researching the budding cannabis industry and working in cryptocurrency space, it has been realized, there is a noticeable miss for a quality merge between the two.  Some previously released big-name coins have been nothing more than forks that offer no real innovation to either industry.  State-mandated systems are nothing more than giant CRUD applications that require tiresome manual data entry and lock you into using their platform at extra costs.  

As you continue to read you will be convinced that GRAMA offers a sound realistic implementation in the tracking of botanical assets, cannabis or otherwise.  Beyond being user-friendly it is also one of the fastest blockchain systems currently in existence that offers a hybrid delegated proof of stake and proof of ownership consensus protocol.

Security is a priority of GRAMA and this is shown in the design of the system that limits corruption to only a single account, minimizing the overall impact on the network to none.  Each account is responsible for its own sidechain that uses proof of ownership while a centralized blockchain is validated using a delegated proof of stake.

The simple but effective transactional layer of GRAMA allows for easy expansion to different verticals: instant secure messaging, decentralized database systems, scientific/research data sharing, biometric identification systems, private blockchains, smart contracts, etc.
